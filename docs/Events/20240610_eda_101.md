# Event-Driven Ansible 101

Learn how Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) can be used to build automatic processes for resolving issues that arise in your environment. Integrate EDA with common vendor solutions to increase environment awareness and reduce the mean-time-to-remediation (MTTR). To wrap it up, see a demo of Event-Driven Ansible integrating with observability solutions to deliver automatic remediation of issues. During the remediation, Ansible will create an audit trail on an ITSM platform to ensure changes can be tracked and reviewed.
