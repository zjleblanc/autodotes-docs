| [Network Resource Modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_resource_modules.html) | Ansible network resource modules simplify and standardize how you manage different network devices. Network devices separate configuration into sections (such as interfaces and VLANs) that apply to a network service. Ansible network resource modules take advantage of this to allow you to configure subsections or resources within the network device configuration. Network resource modules provide a consistent experience across different network devices. |
